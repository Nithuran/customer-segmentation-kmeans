# Customer Segmentation with K-Means

This project applies clustering to segment 68,000+ customers using features like recency, frequency, CLV, and age.

## Tools & Techniques
- K-Means Clustering
- PCA & t-SNE (for visual validation)
- Silhouette Score, Elbow Method
- Python, Pandas, Scikit-Learn, Jupyter

## Key Outcomes
- Identified distinct customer groups with behavioural patterns
- Recommended targeting strategies based on cluster profiles
- Visualised high-dimensional groupings with t-SNE

## What I Learned
- How to apply unsupervised learning to real data
- Best practices for feature scaling and dimensionality reduction
- Interpreting and validating clustering output
